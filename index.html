This is my example index file.
<br>
I made it so that I can show others how to use github to host files. 
<br>
I have a quite satisfactory personal site hosted elsehwere.
<br>
But our parent company's ftp is restrictive in ways I won't go into, and so it's quite handy to be able to show interns how to share project demos on here.
<br>
I used these instructions (with the Windows GitHub client) to set up this page: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a>
<br>
YMMV. Good luck!
